This project aims to demonstrate how to use multiple views using the NavigationService
in Template 10.

See https://github.com/Windows-XAML/Template10/wiki/Multiple-Views for more details.

# Getting Started
The app starts with the main page and the option to navigate to page 2 or open page 2
in a new view. Clicking on the navigation buttons works as with any other UWP app and
this is done to provide the side-by-side comparison with secondary views.
